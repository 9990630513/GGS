                          Our classrooms are installed with specially made German designed furniture. The design specifications of our
                          classrooms allow them to be comfortable, optimally lit, and fully air-conditioned with a capacity to
                          accommodate 40 students; however, the maximum capacity envisaged is 25 students. The tables and benches
                          are carefully carpentered to ensure that the edges are round and smooth so that that it cannot hurt the 
                          children. It has further been ensured that the furniture is comfortable enough to keep the childâ€™s 
                          posture straight and upright
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each classroom is well equipped with the newest quality of study furniture, racks, pegs, pigeon-holes 
                          and many more features for the children to stack up their required study and activity material. There 
                          are also a host of bulletinboards and display boards placed both inside and outside the classrooms. 
                          Most importantly, while adhering to the global standards that Genesis is committed to, the "e-learning 
                          system" has been incorporated as an integral part of the school's learning system. For this, there are
                          "smart boards" with "e-content" provided in each classroom.
