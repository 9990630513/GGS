                            <b>Design & Technology</b>
                            <p>
                              In this new era of technology, we encourage our students to have a hands-on experience in 
                              exploring materials, tools, machines and processes. These are lifelong experiences that will 
                              help our students to not only analyse, create and innovate but also build relationships 
                              between our past and present to develop a better tomorrow. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                              At GGGS we not only provide the student with these skills but also help them understand, 
                              define and communicate their idea on paper through the medium of sketching, building 
                              mock ups & prototypes which are an essential component of any design process activity. 
                              This helps them to think "out of the box" and still create functional products more relevant 
                              to a need than a want.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Along with skills learnt such as solving problems with creative and innovative strategies to 
                              develop a product for a need and to have a function, the students can also choose from a 
                              range of careers that open to them. They also develop good communication skills with team 
                              working capabilities, along with recognising and integrating various expertise while 
                              designing. Design and Technology helps the students in a variety of careers such as; 
                              Architecture, Engineering, Industrial Design, Graphic Design, Fashion Design etc.
                            </p>
