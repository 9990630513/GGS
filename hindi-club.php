                              The purpose of the Hindi-Club is to enhance the creativity of our scholars. The club allows the 
                              students to create their own speeches, nukkad-natak, plays, compose poetry and also write essays
                              to express their thoughts and feelings. Nukkad-Natak is also an integral part of the Hindi Club
                              where Scholars are not only being made aware of important social issues but they themselves take
                              on the responsibility of spreading awareness. The club will also conduct activities like debates
                              tempore to develop thinking and analysing skills of our Scholars.
