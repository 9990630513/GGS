                            I admire the good humanitarian work being done by the KSC Educational Society in running of the charitable school for differently abled children for more than a Decade. I congratulate them for taking yet another step in the field of education through the promotion of Genesis Global School.
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            I am sure that the mentors of Genesis will work tirelessly and full of humility & selflessly as devoted members involved in nurturing leaders for 21st century. Genesis with its collaborative schools will be able to provide international flavor with emphasis on high quality education. The emphasis must also remain on Indian values, time tested character traits like honesty, sincerity, compassion and on sustainability of environment.
                            I am certain this temple of learning will help the students to grow mentally alert and physically sound, prepared to lead their country with distinction.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I wish everyone the best of luck in this noble endeavour.
