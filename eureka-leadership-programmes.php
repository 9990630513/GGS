                              Adventure is one of the pillars of Round Square and in each academic session, GGS provides an opportunity to its students to explore and introspect by organising Adventure camps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              It is fun time for students and teachers alike. However, the idea behind these camps is to expose them to challenging outdoor 
                              activities which has a great impact on a student’s intellectual, physical, spiritual, social and moral development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Adventure camps with activities like rappelling, river crossing, rock climbing, trekking, hiking, navigation and camping enhance skills of problem solving and team building. There is a great deal of 
                              intrinsic enjoyment and satisfaction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              These activities being non-competitive provide avenues for achievement as well as opportunities to develop independence & self-reliance, helping them to overcome fears & apprehensions along the way. 
                            </p>
