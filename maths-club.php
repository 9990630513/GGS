                            <b>Mathematics – The language of the Universe</b>
                            <p>
                              Our world is made up of patterns and sequences. They are all around us. A mathematician acts as 
                              a pattern searcher hunting down the hidden structures that lie behind the complexities of the
                               world around us. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                               In the Mathematics club we encourage our Scholars to think so that they can explore mathematics
                                in all things around them.  We do a lot of activities which develop analytical skills and 
                                logical thinking. Activities are done in groups which develop collaborative thinking and 
                                teamwork. Videos are shown to create awareness of the subject so that students see mathematics 
                                beyond text books. 
                            </p>
