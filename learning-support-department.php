                              Every scholar at Genesis Global School is promised self-trust, which is the essence of 
                              heroism and infinite vitality. Inclusive education sharpens our focus on catering to the needs
                              of special children and assisting them to join the mainstream and reinforcing in them pride 
                              and confidence. A multidisciplinary team of closely involved and dedicated special 
                              educators, speech therapists and occupational therapists assist this team. They work in 
                              close coordination with parents and home tutors to monitor the scholars’ progress and 
                              provide effective support for their needs.

                            <b>English as Second Language (ESL)</b> 
                            <p>
                              The School provides support to students of non- English speaking backgrounds.
                              Our foreign scholars joining school from Korea, Thailand etc, need assistance in 
                              the English language on arrival. English is non-native to India as well, however 
                              it has an established role and has become a predominant language. The ESL 
                              classes are taken either one on one or in very small groups of 3-4 students. The 
                              assessments are individualised as per the needs of each student and so are the 
                              lesson plans. Sometimes the English support teacher offers these Scholars 
                              support within the regular class while on other occasions the ESL teacher may 
                              have to  run special classes for ESL scholars.
