                                The School provides support to students of non- English speaking backgrounds. Our foreign scholars joining school from Korea,
                                Thailand etc, need assistance in the English language on arrival.
                                English is non-native to India as well, however it has an established role and has become a predominant language. The ESL classes are taken either one on one or in very small groups of 3-4 students. The assessments are individualised as per the needs of each
                                student and so are the lesson plans. Sometimes the English
                                support teacher offers these Scholars support within the regular class while on other occasions the ESL teacher may have to  run special classes for ESL scholars.
