                            <p>
                              Aptly titled Clio after the muse (inspiration) for History in Ancient Greece, the society seeks to satiate and cater to the human desire of curiosity regarding the past, present and future thus going beyond the ambit of a History Club and bearing the mantle of an informal discussion group. To put it succinctly we believe history
                              is happening! We get scholars from across the globe such as
                              Sciences Po, Paris, SOAS, London and JNU, Delhi to interact with our scholars. This gives them exposure to think beyond the class room experience of learning. We also have in house discussions in which mentors from across interests and expertise, talk of inter disciplinary nuances, the best example of this was when a
                              Chemistry lecturer gave a talk on Partition and Literature! All this
                              is firmly rooted in our commitment to shape our scholars as global citizens and bring true our motto of Promising Futures.
