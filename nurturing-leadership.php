                              addresses the school on important issues of concern. Medals or prizes, if any, for Inter House and Inter School achievements are also given out in the morning assembly. Finally the assembly is 
                              dispersed after the National Anthem. On Tuesdays the middle and the senior school has a class or a contemplation assembly.  A 
                              contemplation assembly is where a teacher addresses the students giving a talk or presentation on a didactic, informative or inspiring 
                              theme. A special class assembly is an opportunity given to every class to present an assembly on any interesting theme. On
