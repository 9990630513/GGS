                              Cinematography is the art of visual storytelling.  Anyone can set a camera on a tripod and hit 
                              record, but the artistry of cinematography comes in controlling what the viewer  sees (or doesn’t 
                              see) and how  the  image is presented.  Film is a visual medium, and the  best-shot films  are  the 
                              ones  where you  can  tell  what’s  going on  without hearing any  of the  dialogue.
