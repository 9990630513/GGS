                              Round square is based on the philosophy of Kurt Hahn, an exceptional educational leader.
                            <br> <br>
                              He believed that schools should have a greater purpose beyond preparing young people for college 
                              and university. Dr. Hahn believed that it was crucial for scholars to prepare for life by having
                              them face it head on and experience it in ways that would demand courage, generosity, imagination,
                              principle and resolution. As a result, he felt that young people would become empowered and develop
                              the skills and abilities to be the leaders and guardians of the world tomorrow.
