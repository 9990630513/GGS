                              Learning is the quest for truth and the means to express it. Theatre and performing arts are the 
                              means and the avenues. Verbal expression is the first miracle of creative expression and it is 
                              also the most intimate of all. When scholars develop the confidence and begin to express their 
                              inner feelings verbally, the quest for the truth becomes deeper and richer. The key is for 
                              scholars to learn that true expression is not repetition from memory, but feeling, thinking 
                              and perceiving the nuances, and then crafting those feelings, thoughts and perceptions into 
                              their own original and unique way of speaking and communicating.

                              Written creativity – be it poetry, fiction, drama, song or speech holds the key to the search for 
                              truth and catalyses its fulfilment. If scholars are exposed to the richest spoken and written 
                              communication in the early years of learning, they will internally realise the potential of
                               those words, and this will reflect when the scholar begins to express inner feelings verbally. 
                               They will be inspired, guided, and challenged by the words they have absorbed in those early years. Scholars are therefore exposed to the best of poetry, fiction, drama and music as a sound start to fulfilling theatre education. Gradually, scholars are encouraged to express themselves while retaining their individual and original creativity. Recitation, songs, plays, debate, dance are all directed under the guidance of mentors who feel deeply for the scholars and for their inner thoughts. The School offers certified courses through Trinity College in speech and drama. It 
                              also annually hosts an inter-school literary & cultural festival called ‘Landmark’ which is indeed a
                              celebration of youthful creativity and innovation.
