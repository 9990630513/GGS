                        Genesis Global School is an IB World School, authorised to conduct the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and the 
                        Diploma Programme (DP). It has been added as an authorized school for the PYP on the IB public website and on 
                        IBIS, the IB information system.

                        As an IB World School, we are now part of a global community of schools committed to developing knowledgeable, 
                        caring young individuals who will be ready to negotiate their futures successfully and make contributions resulting in a 
                        more harmonious and peaceful world.

                      <p>
                        We hope to see the positive results of choosing PYP evident in our community, as classes of PYP students graduate 
                        from Genesis Global School and undertake activities that enhance social, cultural and economic environments 
                        locally, nationally and perhaps, internationally.

                                All scholars at Genesis can pursue their learning in an uninhibited and non- restrictive manner. The school aims 
                                for providing holistic development to its scholars and is opposed to a rigid and stressful examination policy. Keeping 
                                this in mind, the school follows the CCE system of CBSE, in the middle and senior school. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The all-round development of the scholar is assessed through a variety of interesting activities, 
                                rather than just a summative examination. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Therefore equal importance is given to scholastic and co-scholastic areas and scholars are graded not only in terms 
                                of their knowledge, but also participation and involvement in the class , inter-house and inter-school activities.

                                  The driving force behind the IB Primary Years Programme is a deeply held philosophy about the nature of an 
                                  international education. To meet the diverse needs of the scholars– physical, social, intellectual, aesthetic and 
                                  cultural – schools following the PYP ensure the learning is engaging, relevant, challenging and significant. Learning is 
                                  central to the programme and the critical element in developing an international perspective and creating lifelong 
                                  learners. This must begin with each scholar’s ability to consider and reflect upon the point of view of someone else in 
                                  the same class.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  The Primary Years Programme (PYP) looks at the above through enquiry, which puts the onus of learning on the 
                                  learner. Enquiry is experiential in nature and scholars explore the world and arrive at an understanding through 
                                  experiences. Using the inquiry method, scholars explore specific areas of study. These units are carefully planned 
                                  across the year levels to provide a complete and coherent curriculum which is of global significance, provides an 
                                  awareness of the human condition and commonalities through various cultures. It also gives them sensitivity to the 
                                  diversity of our world.

                                The IGCSE curriculum encourages learner-centred and enquiry-based approaches to learning. It develops learners’

                                IGCSE is a two year curriculum starting in Grade 9. In most subjects there is a choice between core and extended 
                                curricula, making IGCSE suitable for a wide range of abilities. There are clear guidelines which explain the standard

                                October/November. Results are declared in August and January.
