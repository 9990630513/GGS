                                The school aims to take the scholars to higher levels
                                of Bloom’s Taxonomy wherein they not only know and understand a concept but are also able to analyse and apply it in a new situation to create new things or understanding. Curriculum is designed to enhance various skills amongst the students like Communicative Skills, Collaborative Skills, Media Literacy, Lateral Thinking, Reflective Skills etc. to name just a few. Our school has also taken an initiative
                                to induce among our students Entrepreneurship Skills. Lessons are planned to infuse in them the key elements
                                of entrepreneurship like being a good communicator,
                                risk taker, reflective, enquirer, thinker, disciplined etc.
