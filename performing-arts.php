                            <p>
                              Music education is one of the most important fields in education. From physical to spiritual, music 
                              plays an integral role in our personal development. 
                              It allows us to express our needs and desires through song as well as gives us an insight into some of the interesting 
                              aspects of our history. Music also allows us to develop other aspects of our minds by giving us a multi-faceted form of 
                              expression that we can use to gain a better insight into the world around us.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                             Music is a rich inheritance we can pass on to posterity. It allows us to stay not only informed about the people around the world but ourselves as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Throughout a year, presentations are made by scholars in various celebrations (Indian and International) which help them in developing their presentation skills. Scholars enthusiastically practice and present music in conjunction with multi lingual celebrations and different competitions. These competitions are the inter-house music competition and the multi-cultural festival called ‘Landmark’ which is the first co- curricular based competition that has been organised by our school.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                              Scholars either learn Western Contemporary Music (vocal and instrumental) or Indian Classical Music (vocal and instrumental). They are also given adequate time to pursue an instrument of their choice - guitar, drums, synthesizer, piano, flute, tabla, violin, harmonium, sitar etc.
                             </p>
                              <p>
                               Scholars also prepare for their piano grade exams from Trinity College of Music, London. These classes are held twice a week during the Extended Day Programme.
                              </p>
                            </p>
