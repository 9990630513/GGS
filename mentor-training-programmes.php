                                  latest nuances of technology, methodology and changing practices of the national and international curriculum. 
                                  Emphasis is continuously placed on the compassionate, empathic and impartial role of the mentor in the scholar's
                                  learning process.

                                  The CBSE has a very structured curriculum. Though the teachers have the liberty to design their own curriculum 
                                  till class VIII, we strictly follow books prescribed for CBSE for classes IX and above. With the coming of CCE,
                                  education has become activity oriented and the focus has shifted towards continuous assessment of the children
                                  through a plethora of challenging, inquiry and research based activities. The aim is to achieve stress free 
                                  education and promote creativity and innovation while testing the children both on scholastic and co scholastic
                                  areas. The course content in CBSE, particularly in Science and Math, is robust and a lot of attention is paid 
                                  to application of knowledge. The board has undergone a significant change over the last 10 years and the focus
                                  has shifted from passive learning to learning through experience and experimentation. The Formative Assessment
                                  in CBSE is largely based on this concept. The Formative Assessment is an ongoing process, four times in a year
                                  (twice in a term) and carries a total weightage of 40% whereas the Summative Assessment is the written exam at
                                  the end of each term which carries a total of 60% weightage.
