                            <p>
                              Adventure is one of the pillars of Round Square & each academic session, Genesis provides an 
                              opportunity to its students to explore and introspect by organizing Adventure camps.

                              It is fun time for students and teachers alike. However, the idea behind these camps is to expose 
                              them to challenging outdoor 
                              activities which has a great impact on a child’s intellectual, 
                              physical, spiritual, social and moral development.

                              navigation and night camping enhance skills of problem solving and team building. There is a great
                              deal of intrinsic enjoyment and satisfaction that is experienced.

                              These activities being non-competitive provide avenues for achievement as well as opportunities to 
                              develop independence and self- reliance, helping them to overcome fears and apprehensions along the 
                              way. Trust, care and tolerance to give and accept are encouraged to develop interpersonal skills 
                              while working in teams. It contributes to good health and physical fitness and sense of appreciation 
                              for the environment.
