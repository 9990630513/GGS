                            <p>
                              Adventure is one of the pillars of Round Square and each academic session, Genesis
                              provides an opportunity to its students to explore and introspect 
                              by organizing Adventure camps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              It is fun time for students and teachers alike. However, the idea behind these camps is 
                              to expose them to challenging outdoor activities which has a great impact on a child’s 
                              intellectual, physical, spiritual, social and moral development.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Adventure camps with activities like rappelling, river crossing, rock climbing, trekking, 
                              hiking, navigation and night camping enhance skills of problem solving and team 
                              building. There is a great deal of intrinsic enjoyment and satisfaction that is 
                              experienced.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              These activities being non-competitive provide avenues for achievement as well as 
                              opportunities to develop independence and self- reliance, helping them to overcome 
                              fears and apprehensions along the way. Trust, care and tolerance to give and accept 
                              are encouraged to develop interpersonal skills while working in teams. It contributes to 
                              good health and physical fitness and sense of appreciation for the environment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              As the citizen of tomorrow they become equipped to adapt and cope with the rapidly changing world.
