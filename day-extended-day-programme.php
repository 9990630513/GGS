                          At Genesis, scholars have an option of being day scholars or extended day scholars. The extended day programme is a wonderful option to suit the convenience of both parents and children. Scholars have the option to stay back till 5:45 pm and be a part of the extended day programme where they participate in various interesting activities, sports and academics. The child can play seasonal games or opt for specialised coaching in a particular sport. The extended day
                          programme is therefore an extremely prod
                          uctive exercise instilling versatility and sportsmanship in scholars.
