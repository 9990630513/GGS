                          Here at Genesis, we strongly believe that technology will never be able to replace books though it may 
                          well alter its and books coupled with a resource centre, carves out an impeccable amalgamation of 
                          wholesome knowledge provided to all the students. A huge spectrum of books authored by acclaimed writers
                          of various genres is available to children at the Genesis Library. This encourages and inculcates in 
                          them a love for reading that not only provides sheer joy but also further develops and enhances many 
                          skills in them
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Further, the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) in society is reflected in
                          government pocies to encourage the use of ICT in education and the development of educational
                          multimedia. As the role of educational multimedia increases, it is increasingly important to have 
                          an idea of the potential it affords for teaching and learning. Thus, by understanding its significance, 
                          we plan to proffer this facility to our senior students by the next acdemic year. Our Library-Media
                          Centre also features story telling counters where children can enjoy and relax by quietly listening 
                          to stories.
