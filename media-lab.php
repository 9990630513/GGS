                            <p>
                              Education has continued to evolve, diversify and extend its reach and coverage since the dawn of human history. There are various methods for making the curriculum more interesting, enjoyable and child-centered. Attempts have been made using media like puppetry, theatre, songs, games, etc. In this direction Genesis has used photography to make subjects like the environment, heritage, nature, people, festivals, places, etc., more interesting and
                              meaningful for children.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                              In children, much like in adults, photography provides the thrill of catching and freezing a moment, a scene, a smile, a movement and looking back at it. It is a creative art involving the child physically and psychologically. The pride of reproducing a moment
                              encourages the child to look at the world through his own eyes. Photography helps make education more interesting for children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              At Genesis we believe each child is blessed with their own unique talent and it is our endeavor to facilitate their creative expression hence young photographers are encouraged. Children’s work finds pride of place all around the school.
