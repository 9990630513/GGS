                                  Education is a journey of discovery and growth, and we take the best from Central Board Of 
                                  Secondary Education (CBSE), Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) and International 
                                  Baccalaureate (IB). The School is an CBSE, CIE (CS1 & IGCSE) and IB (PYP & DP) authorised

                                  Our curriculum is comprehensive and based on core subjects, facilitating not just knowledge, 
                                  but also the development of concepts, ideas and skills. 
                                </p>

                                  Genesis believes that learning is a dynamic process where each scholar learns differently. We 
                                  provide developmentally appropriate practices by teaching in ways that match the way scholars
                                  develop and learn. It provides daily experiences to scholars to discover that they are 
                                  competent and capable learners. Considering the current demands of international careers the
                                  School supports additional learning of French, German and Spanish, as a part of the 
                                  curriculum. Mandarin has also been proposed to be introduced in the School's curriculum,soon.

                                  Language comprehension, focusing on listening, speaking, reading and writing skills are 
                                  fundamental to all subjects. Cognitive development, intellectual development, interpretation 
                                  and thinking skills are more complex secondary skills that follow. The overall personal, 
                                  social and emotional development of the scholar is constantly monitored to ensure a strong
                                  foundation for the adult years.

                                  The entire learning of each scholar is divided into four phases, with each phase, requiring 
                                  its own focus area and hence its own philosophy.

                                  A regular feedback to parents regarding homework and involvement and progress of scholars, 
                                  keeps parents well-informed and ensures a closely monitored development programme for their 
                                  children. This also helps the school in initiating remedial measures, as and when required. 
                                  A regular and productive communication between parents and mentors is encouraged in both the
                                  informal and formal spheres. Parent- Mentor meetings are held at regular intervals.

                                    All scholars at Genesis can pursue their learning in an uninhibited and non- restrictive
                                     manner. The school aims for providing holistic development to its scholars and is opposed
                                      to a rigid and stressful examination policy. Keeping this in mind, the school follows the 
                                      CCE system of CBSE, in the middle and senior school. The all-round development of the 
                                      scholar is assessed through a variety of interesting activities, rather than just a 
                                      summative examination. Therefore equal importance is given to scholastic and co-scholastic
                                       areas and scholars are graded not only in terms of their knowledge, but also participation
                                       and involvement in the class , inter-house and inter-school activities.

                                      The driving force behind the IB Primary Years Programme is a deeply held philosophy about the
                                     nature of an international education. To meet the diverse needs of the scholars– physical, 
                                     social, intellectual, aesthetic and cultural – schools following the PYP ensure the learning
                                      is engaging, relevant, challenging and significant. Learning is central to the programme and
                                       the critical element in developing an international perspective and creating lifelong
                                        learners. This must begin with each scholar's ability to consider and reflect upon the 
                                        point of view of someone else in the same class.

                                      The Primary Years Programme (PYP) looks at the above through enquiry, which puts the onus of
                                     learning on the learner. Enquiry is experiential in nature and scholars explore the world and
                                      arrive at an understanding through experiences. Using the inquiry method, scholars explore 
                                      specific areas of study. These units are carefully planned across the year levels to provide
                                       a complete and coherent curriculum which is of global significance, provides an awareness of
                                        the human condition and commonalities through various cultures. It also gives them 
                                        sensitivity to the diversity of our world.
