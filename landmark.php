                              Genesis Global School began its journey in the year 2010 with a vision to produce confident and
                               sensitive future leaders. We believe that a harmonious blend of the academic and the co-curricular 
                               would certainly add panache to the personality of students.
                            </p>

                              LANDMARK, a cultural journey, has been conceived with the same thought that our students will 
                              truly be scholars only when they are well versed with music, art and literature. In order to 
                              create global citizens of tomorrow, the students must develop a healthy spirit of competition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Inclusive education has been one of the hallmarks of the educational philosophy of our school and 
                              we have organized a special non-competitive event for the special needs children wherein they will
                               be free to put up a dance or a music performance.
                            </p>  
                            <p>
                              LANDMARK, a vibrant and colourful festival, promises an equal and fair opportunity to every student
                               who “Aspires to Inspire”. It offers a plethora of activities that will unfurl the creativity of 
                               every child. From the feisty Ad-Mad to the exciting Quiz, soulful music to the rhapsody of rhythmic
                                dances, it has all been designed to propel the intellect and discover the latent potential of every 
                                individual. Landmark is indeed a celebration of youthful scholars and their innovation and talent.
