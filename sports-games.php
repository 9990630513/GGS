              Physical activity through sports and games is an essential ingredient of the personality development of every scholar. We believe that academics and sports are compatible and complimentary
              in realising the child’s full potential.
              Activity on the playfield develops the qualities of teamwork, leadership, dedication, discipline, self-confidence and self-esteem. They get ingrained in the psyche and enable each scholar to overcome the trials and tribulations of life. Sports equip scholars to face the challenges of an increasingly competitive world.
            </p>
             <p>
              The cornerstone of the sports curriculum is the recognition of every child’s
              right to sport. It is designed on the understanding that children have vastly varying physical abilities and hence require different types of sports and games.
              The school offers world-class facilities in 21 sports and games, and strives to meaningfully involve all scholars in it.
              The sports policy ensures a smooth transition from childhood play to competitive sports. In the initial years children will be encouraged to joyously participate in the mother sports of running, swimming and freehand

              gymnastics. Scholars in the Junior School enjoy the ‘Wings’ programme which focusses on developing gross motor skills and coordination while older scholars get to explore and display their special sporting talent.
              As they grow the school ensures that their curriculum is upgraded accordingly. Special training regimes are individually developed by highly qualified and experienced instructors keeping in view the ability, talent
              and the potential of every child.
              We offer opportunities for international

             <p>
             exposure through overseas sports exchanges and by inviting foreign teams to the campus. Regular campus visits by eminent sports personalities for interactive sessions are planned with a view
              to motivate scholars through interaction with their role models.
