                            <b>Overview</b>
                            <p>
                              Co-curricular activities in school build character and develop multiple skills in scholars. A plethora of
                              activities in literature, art, science, performing arts and sports, benefits scholars immensely. We also 
                              cultivate non- academic skills such as leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Inter-school competitions expose scholars to difficult yet real-world situations, thus, training them to 
                              become competent individuals. Interaction with scholars of different schools makes scholars aware of 
                              the community around them. It also makes them aware of the international standards maintained at 
                              Genesis Global School.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              At the end of their schooling, we want our scholars to not only be academically successful, but also 
                              multifaceted, forward thinking, bringing with them leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship.
                              Writing and publishing is at the forefront for both day scholars and Resident Scholars. The scholars 
                              publish four magazines and newsletters.
