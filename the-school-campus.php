              Genesis Global School is situated in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, and is part of the National Capital Region (Delhi NCR). The School is spread across a world-class 30 acre campus, with super connectivity via the six-lane Taj Expressway. It is
              an hour’s drive from the Indira Gandhi International Airport at Delhi.
            </p>
             <p>
              The campus was designed by Team 3, Singapore and Nostri – an architectural firm. A Wi-Fi enabled campus, complete with spacious e-classrooms, multimedia library, computerised labs and classrooms; form the backbone of the academic infrastructure, which is at par with international standards.
            </p>
             <p>
              Genesis prides itself on providing extensive sports venues of the highest global specifications, including a fully
              air- conditioned multi sports indoor hall covering 1,10,000 sq. ft., an Olympic size 50m swimming pool, a separate toddler’s pool, a 400m athletic track, three sports fields, tennis, badminton, basketball and squash courts, a shooting range and a horse riding arena. 24/7 security of the campus is ensured through strategically located surveillance cameras and CCTV monitoring by trained security personnel.
            </p>
             <p>
             The green campus concept has been employed in planning and construction of the school. The highlights of this approach include the use of fly ash in building material, solar heating, water harvesting, recycling of waste, effluent treatment, plastic free and chemical free landscaping. Bio-waste management is being actively considered at the moment.
