              Genesis Global School is situated in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, and is part of the National Capital Region (Delhi NCR). The School is spread across a world-class 30 acre campus, with super connectivity via the six-lane Taj Expressway. It is
              an hour’s drive from the Indira Gandhi International Airport at Delhi.
            </p>
             <p>
              The campus was designed by Team 3, Singapore and Nostri – an architectural firm. A Wi-Fi enabled campus, complete with spacious e-classrooms, multimedia library, computerised labs and classrooms; form the backbone of the academic infrastructure, which is at par with international standards.
            </p>
             <p>
              Genesis prides itself on providing extensive sports venues of the highest global specifications, including a fully
              air- conditioned multi sports indoor hall covering 1,10,000 sq. ft., an Olympic size 50m swimming pool, a separate toddler’s pool, a 400m athletic track, three sports fields, tennis, badminton, basketball and squash courts, a shooting range and a horse riding arena. 24/7 security of the campus is ensured through strategically located surveillance cameras and CCTV monitoring by trained security personnel.
            </p>
             <p>
             The green campus concept has been employed in planning and construction of the school. The highlights of this approach include the use of fly ash in building material, solar heating, water harvesting, recycling of waste, effluent treatment, plastic free and chemical free landscaping. Bio-waste management is being actively considered at the moment.

                  <b> Junior School </b>
                    The Primary Years Programme (PYP) allows mentors to encourage and develop each child’s individual interests. The IB PYP in the Pre- Primary acknowledges that young children are constructing their own meaning and provides a framework that gives support for them to be active learners and inquirers, whilst nurturing their basic skills and needs, providing a sound beginning to the continuum of learning that goes on throughout the Primary Years.
                  </p>
                
                <p>
                They construct meaning and experience the world around them. It is a part of their indoor and outdoor environment and continuously provides them with the opportunities to comfortably express themselves and quench their natural instinct of being curious. Play in a safe and secure environment allows children to take on challenges courageously, explore new things and learn to solve problems.

                  The Primary School comprises of Grade 1 to 5. The teaching pedagogy of the primary years focuses on developing the intellectual capabilities of learners to the fullest; it endeavours to cultivate an aptitude for reasoning and exploration. Enquiry is inherent to the IB Primary Years Programme and learning in a transdisciplinary manner enhances the scope for enquiry.

                  Further, the focus moves from a content driven curriculum to a concept driven curriculum, meaning that learners explore not just the what and how of facts but delve deeper into the why and so what. The learners become independent and take on the responsibility for their learning. They are equipped with skills to ensure critical thinking, independence in research, self-management, collaborative learning and expression, enabling them to be life long learners. To ensure that each scholar gets the requisite attention, we have a low mentor-scholar ratio and our faculty monitors each student’s progress through continuous assessments. These range from Pre-knowledge to formative and summative assessments.

                  <b> Senior School </b>
                  The middle school extends from Grades 6 to 8. One of the most important functions of middle school is enabling scholars to develop and master their areas of interest. Scholars are taught how to harness their talents. The emphasis is on logical and critical thinking. Exploiting the infrastructural advantages, such as libraries, multimedia rooms and laboratories plays a major role in this stage of development. We ensure access to everything that they require to complete projects, conduct experiments and study concepts. Feedback and assessment is very important in any learning process and scholars are provided the same, thus enabling them to build on their performance.

                  <b> Senior Secondary School </b>
                  The senior school consists of Grades 9 to 12. These years are further divided into two phases of Grades 9 and 10 and Grades 11 and 12, which is the threshold to under graduate studies. These two years require scholars to focus on specific areas of specialisation. The learning evolves into a more competitive effort and mentors recommend useful reading material, as well as supplementary texts. Professional career counselling and advice on university education, through the University Placement Cell (UPC) is the final role played by the school at this stage.
