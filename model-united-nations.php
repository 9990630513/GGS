                              An academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate participants about current events,
                              topics in international relations, diplomacy and the United Nations agenda. Participants
                              research a country, take on roles as diplomats, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, 
                              consult, and then 
                              develop solutions to world problems. During a conference; participants must employ a variety of 
                              communication and critical thinking skills in order to represent the policies of the country they 
                              represent. These skills include public speaking, group communication, research, policy analysis, active
                               listening, negotiation, conflict resolution, note taking, and technical writing.

                            <b>GENESIS MUN 2015</b>
                            <p>
                              A most spirited and unforgettable experience for everyone including the Secretariat, the Organizing 
                              Committee, the Executive Board members, the school staff & all the delegates & the International Press
                               members that were present. The conference was conducted with much vigorous debate and most importantly,
                                in-depth learning, thanks to the Executive board members. The number of delegates were over 250 and 
                                there was participation from over 20 schools. In addition there was individual participation as well. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The experience truly did revive the dying trend of excellent MUNs that held the 'educating' factor and 
                              'introspection about real social issues' above the use of mere role-play. Some of the keynote speakers that
                               appeared for the event were Mr. Pushpesh Pant, Mr. Maroof Razaa, Ms. Tanya Kak, Ms. Syeda Asia and Mr.
                                Tanna .The Committees included General Assembly First Committee (DISEC) 
                              [Agenda: Revising the UN Use of Force Regime], UN Security Council (UNSC) [Agenda: Threats to International
                               Peace and Security caused by Non State Military Organizations and Violent Non State Actors], Human Rights 
                               Council (HRC) [Agenda: Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity],
                               Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)[Agenda: Safeguarding the Rights of Muslim Communities in Non-OIC
                                Member States], Bretton Woods Conference, 1944 
                              (BWC)[Agenda: International and Monetary Financial Order],Indian Parliament's Expert Panel 
                              (IPEP)[Agenda: Indian Pharmaceutical Laws and the required reforms with respect to Intellectual Property 
                              Rights (IPR)],Lok Sabha (LS)[Agenda: Constitutional Review] and Transfer Policy Meet (TPM)[Agenda: Transfer
                               Window Action]. Of these, the TPM was an unconventional committee- a first timer and an innovation of our 
                               own Secretariat members that blended football and politics with all four clubs-the two Manchester greats and 
                               the two London greats - Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                              For the first time in the history of MUNs, websites for each committee were created with continuous 
                              updates which added to the research of delegates instead of just background guides to resort to. 
                              Also, the International Press did a wonderful job with journalists and photographers working hard to
                               capture some of the most crucial parts of the events through their reports and photographs. Everyone 
                               who attended , be it delegate, teacher, EB member or guest, left with a sense of accomplishment of 
                               having invested their time in something so deeply gratifying.
