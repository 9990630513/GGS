                            <p>
                              Images convey a lot of information because the human visual system is a sophisticated
                              information processor. It follows, then, that moving images have the potential to convey much more information. To 'animate' is literally 'to give life to'. 'Animating' is moving
                              something which can't move itself. Animation adds to graphics the dimension of time which vastly increases the amount of information which can be transmitted.

                            <p>
                              The main objective of this club is to have students develop an understanding of
                              fundamental techniques used for computer animation. At the end of the term,students will be able 
                              to identify the advantages & disadvantages of using simulation, procedural animation, motion
                               capture, & hand designed animations, with respect to both online & offline applications. They 
                               will also be able to implement animation techniques, using common software languages and tools.
                                Finally, in addition to an understanding of current practices in computer animation, a general 
                                objective is for students to better recognize current important challenges in computer 
                                animation.
