                          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                          <p> 
                            Education is a journey and at Genesis this journey is full
                            of opportunities and fulfilment. The scholars of Genesis are confident, disciplined and critical thinkers. These qualities ensure that they grow into responsible and caring adults of a global society. We encourage experiential learning and create specific opportunities for growth.  </p>

                          <p><b>Keeping the above in mind, the curriculum is designed to go beyond academics.</b></p>

                          <p> Learning of the highest quality is possible in an environment where scholars feel valued and respected. At Genesis, the democratic ethos permeate every aspect of interaction with scholars, parents and mentors. It is in such an environment, that our scholars develop an understanding of their strengths and the areas of improvement. This in turn leads to a healthy self-respect and increased confidence in their problem-solving abilities.</p>

                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
                          <p> We respect individual uniqueness and celebrate the integrity and dignity of each student. The conduct of a scholar at Genesis is based upon - respect for self, consideration for others and concern for the environment. </p>

                          <p> As a school, academic achievement is valued and supported. Our curriculum seeks to balance physical, emotional, social and spiritual growth with academics. We develop in our scholars optimism, confidence, enthusiasm, concern for justice and
                          an idealism, which will metamorphose into growth, and a global perspective that they should carry as young adults.</p>
