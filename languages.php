                                  Every teacher is a teacher of Language.  Language is the driving force that

                                  Language is obviously a vital tool. Not only is it a means of communicating thoughts and ideas, but it 
                                  forges friendships, cultural ties, and economic relationships. Not only do we all have the opportunity to 
                                  learn about other cultures; we instil the values of tolerance and respect in our Scholars.

                                  Through bilingualism, we enable the younger generation with tools and knowledge for them to excel not only
                                  at home, but beyond our national borders. This has allowed them to reach for their dreams.

                                  Language of course, is “knowledge” and in our world today, knowledge is one of the key factors in competitiveness.
                                  In an advanced industrial society, in an increasingly interdependent world, the knowledge of other languages 
                                  becomes indispensable. Just think of how the advent of the Internet has changed our lives.

                                  As we enter a new century and millennium, we must all inspire to continue to make this country strong and 
                                  competitive, by nurturing and providing the younger generation with the tools to succeed.
