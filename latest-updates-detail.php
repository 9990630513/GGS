                      <h2>Genesis Global School is hosting its first Round Square conference this month</h2>

                        Since its inception 6 years ago, our school has been inculcating the 6 IDEALS of Round Square in all its
                         programmes, in a myriad of different ways. Be it taking students for exchanges to different countries to
                          promote Internationalism or promoting Democracy where the student council gets voted in by students and
                           they get to choose their council members.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When we sat down to decide the theme of our conference, we tried to search for a theme that held 
                        relevance to each IDEAL of Round Square. We found that ‘Inclusion’ is something that is pertinent to
                         every IDEAL and it is something that is greatly needed in our world today. Democracy, equality, 
                         tolerance and dignity together work hand in hand, paving the path of inclusion.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During the conference, we aim to inspire each one of you to envisage a world where everyone is given equal importance, equal respect and equal rights and then encourage you to work towards turning this aspiration into reality.
                        Best wishes to all the participants!
                      </p>
